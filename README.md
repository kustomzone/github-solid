# github-solid
Convert Github (Octokit) data to Solid

Possible goals in order of difficulty and value:

- To be procedurally extract githib data and load it into solid from the command line (or web app?)

- To provide a function which fetches a part of a solid virtal pod which in fact is mapped from the state of github

- To provdie real-time sync between the state of solid
